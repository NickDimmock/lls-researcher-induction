## Libguides

- [https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk/](https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk/)

Our Libguides homepage is a good starting point for all LLS services.

## NELSON

- [https://nelson.northampton.ac.uk/](https://nelson.northampton.ac.uk/)
- Found on the Libguides homepage (or Google ‘NELSON Northampton’).

NELSON is our discovery tool - use it to search electronic and physical resources.

?> NELSON will search our subscribed resources by default, which means any electronic results will be immediately available. Use the **Include results without full text** option after searching to include non-subscribed sources.

!> It's a good idea to log into NELSON when starting a session - this can make access to articles easier, and will store any bookmarked items to your account.

## A-Z of Databases

- [https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk/az.php](https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk/az.php)
- Found in the [NELSON](https://nelson.northampton.ac.uk/) main menu, or on the [Libguides](https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk) homepage.

Direct access to our subscribed resources and databases. Sometimes these can offer more focused or specialised search tools than NELSON.

?> The list also includes links to services like [Box of Broadcasts](https://login.learningonscreen.ac.uk/) (for recordings of TV programmes) and [EThOS](http://ethos.bl.uk/) (for UK PhD theses).

## Reference Management

### Zotero

- [https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)
- Click **Download** and install the Zotero app to get started.
- Browser import tool: [https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors)
  - Also found in the **Tools** menu in Zotero.
- Word plugin: [https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration)
- Help: [https://www.zotero.org/support/](https://www.zotero.org/support/)

?> If you're not already using a reference management tool, I recommend trying Zotero first.

!> You can use Zotero without creating an account. Accounts are useful for syncing your library - if you create an account, it will be a personal account rather than a university one, and you'll need to set (and remember!) your own password.

### RefWorks

- [https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk/az.php?a=r](https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk/az.php?a=r)

!> There are several ways to log into RefWorks. To ensure you access your university account, use the link above from the [A-Z of Databases](https://libguides.northampton.ac.uk/az.php).

### Mendeley

- [https://www.mendeley.com/](https://www.mendeley.com/)
- Click **Create a free account** to get started with Mendeley.

!>  An account is required to use Mendeley. I recommend using your personal email for this.
Mac users will need to select the appropriate version of Mendeley Desktop for their version of MacOS - [Reference Manager](https://www.mendeley.com/download-reference-manager/macOS) for 10.15 (Mojave) and later, or [Mendeley Desktop](https://www.mendeley.com/download-mendeley-desktop-legacy/macOS) for earlier systems. You may also need to select the appropriate Word plugin for your version of Office.
